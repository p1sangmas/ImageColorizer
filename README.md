## Setup

### Backend
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>/backend
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained model from the [DDColor repository](https://github.com/piddnad/DDColor) and place it in the `backend` directory. Rename the model file to `path_to_you_model.pt` or update the `MODEL_PATH` in `backend/app.py` accordingly.

4. Ensure you have a CUDA-compatible GPU if you want to use GPU acceleration.

---

### iOS App
1. Open the `ImageColorizer.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.

2. Set up your development team in the project settings for code signing.

3. Build and run the app on a simulator or a physical device.

---

## Usage

### Running the Backend
1. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. The server will start:
 You can use the following endpoints:
   - `/process_image`: Upload a grayscale image to colorize.
   - `/process_video`: Upload a grayscale video to colorize.

### Running the iOS App
1. Launch the app on your iOS device or simulator.
2. Use the app to upload grayscale images or videos and view the colorized results.
